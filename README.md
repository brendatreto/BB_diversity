# Bellybutton Biodiversity

The purpose of this project was to create a dashboard that showed specific information that could be useful for each volunteer.

We completed a panel for the demographic information where each volunteer could look up their ID number and their results would be displayed:

After this selection, three different graphs were generated:
1. A bar graph displaying the top ten bacteria cultures found
